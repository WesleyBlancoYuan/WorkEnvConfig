# WorkEnvConfig
Some useful applications for setting my work environment, including:

- all .pref files from .metadata/.plugin of Eclipse workspace, for all settings about syntax coloring and theme, etc. You can only check every color code and use them to replace original color in original .pref file, shall not replace the entire file. The .pref files contains more than coloring settings. **NOTE**: `mytheme.forhome.epf` is the latest and good one. After importing, the folding gutter will be blank; just <kbd>ctrl+-</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl+/</kbd> to update color and all will be fine.
- Mactype for win64
- ScreenToGif

Must compress all packages in .zip files. In my working environment there is no WinRAR.
