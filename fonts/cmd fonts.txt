HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Console: 

    all user defined console settings, including Git Bash, etc. Tried add CodePage(936) and not working. Still 850.


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Console\TrueTypeFont

    Console font settings (cannot affect 850??)
    0, 00, 000,... will be shown. If system language set to Chinese, 936, 0936, 00936... but now none works. No restart needed.


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts

    All installed fonts. Copy name(not value) to the second location to set font. Don't include the final space and content in the parenthesis. For example, font names are usually like "Yahei Mono (True Type)", just copy "Yahei Mono".


If not working, change in Control Panel - Region and Language - Management - non-Unicode application language, set to Chinese and restart, because cmd and powershell don't use Unicode, so they are controlled by this switch.
